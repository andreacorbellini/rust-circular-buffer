# Circular Buffer for Rust

[![Crate](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/circular-buffer)](https://crates.io/crates/circular-buffer) [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/docsrs/circular-buffer)](https://docs.rs/circular-buffer/latest/circular_buffer/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/circular-buffer)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/)

This is a Rust crate that implements a [circular buffer], also known as cyclic
buffer, circular queue or ring.

This circular buffer has a fixed maximum capacity, does not automatically grow,
and by default once its maximum capacity is reached, elements at the start of the buffer
are overwritten. It's useful for implementing fast FIFO (_first in, first out_)
and LIFO (_last in, first out_) queues with a fixed memory capacity.

# Example

```rust
use circular_buffer::CircularBuffer;

// Initialize a new, empty circular buffer with a capacity of 5 elements
let mut buf = CircularBuffer::<5, u32>::new();

// Add a few elements
buf.push_back(1);
buf.push_back(2);
buf.push_back(3);
assert_eq!(buf.to_vec(), vec![1, 2, 3]);

// Add more elements to fill the buffer capacity completely
buf.push_back(4);
buf.push_back(5);
assert_eq!(buf.to_vec(), vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

// Adding more elements than the buffer can contain causes the front elements to be
// automatically dropped
buf.push_back(6);
assert_eq!(buf.to_vec(), vec![2, 3, 4, 5, 6]); // `1` got dropped to make room for `6`
```
